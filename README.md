# MachineLearning_FinalProject
This is my collaborative final project for Machine Learning course at NYU Tandon

This is a project in which 3 machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks

The dataset is characteristics of players of the fictional sport Quidditch and the target vector is if the player is a professional.

The objective of the project is to be able to predict if a player whether a player will make it to the professional league.
